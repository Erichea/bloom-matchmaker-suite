description: Logout the current user

The user wants to logout. Inform them that they can log out by:
1. Going to their profile page at /client/profile
2. Scrolling to the bottom and clicking the "Log out" button in the Account section

Note: As an AI assistant, I cannot directly execute logout actions in a running application, but the user can use the logout button that's now available in their profile page.
