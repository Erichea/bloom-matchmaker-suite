# Claude Sonnet 4.5 Prompt for PWA Logout Issue

## Context
I'm working on a React + TypeScript PWA app with Supabase authentication. I have a critical logout persistence issue where users remain logged in after closing and reopening the PWA, despite implementing comprehensive logout cleanup mechanisms.

## Problem Details
**Issue**: PWA logout doesn't persist across app restarts. When users log out and close/reopen the PWA, they're automatically logged back in.

**Current Implementation**: I've already implemented multiple layers of logout cleanup including localStorage clearing, service worker cache deletion, IndexedDB cleanup, and a logout state persistence mechanism, but the issue persists.

## What I Need You To Do

1. **Analyze the current logout implementation** in these key files:
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Auth context with logout logic and session management
   - `src/pages/LogoutPage.tsx` - Logout page with comprehensive cleanup
   - `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client configuration

2. **Identify the root cause** of why Supabase sessions are still being restored on PWA restart despite all cleanup mechanisms

3. **Implement a robust solution** that ensures logout state persists across PWA restarts

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented:
- Complete localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup for Supabase auth keys
- Service worker cache clearing
- IndexedDB database deletion
- Logout state persistence using `bloom_user_logged_out` flag
- Auth initialization that checks logout flag before session restoration
- Double logout (auth context + direct Supabase call)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### üîç Key Issue:
The logout state persistence mechanism (`bloom_user_logged_out` flag) may not be preventing Supabase's automatic session restoration properly. Supabase client is configured with `persistSession: true` and `autoRefreshToken: true`.

## Technical Environment
- **Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Auth**: Supabase with localStorage persistence
- **PWA**: Vite PWA plugin with service worker
- **Storage**: localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB

## Investigation Approach

Please follow this systematic approach:

1. **First**: Read and analyze the current implementation in the three key files mentioned above
2. **Identify**: Why the logout state persistence isn't working - is it timing, Supabase configuration, or PWA-specific behavior?
3. **Design**: A robust solution that accounts for PWA persistence behavior
4. **Implement**: The fix with proper error handling and logging
5. **Test**: Ensure the solution works for both normal browser and PWA contexts

## Requirements for the Solution

- Must work in PWA environment (not just regular browser)
- Must persist logout state across complete app closures
- Must not interfere with normal login flow
- Must handle edge cases (network issues, storage failures, etc.)
- Should be backwards compatible
- Must include comprehensive logging for debugging

## Expected Outcome
After implementing your solution:
1. User logs out ‚Üí All auth data cleared, logout state saved
2. User closes PWA completely
3. User reopens PWA ‚Üí User remains logged out (no automatic session restoration)
4. User must manually log in again to access protected areas

## Debugging Information
I've created a detailed troubleshooting guide in `TROUBLESHOOTING-PWA-LOGOUT.md` with current implementation status, debugging steps performed, and potential root causes.

Please read that file first, then analyze the code and implement a comprehensive solution.

## Notes
- This is a production app, so please be careful with breaking changes
- The Supabase configuration is currently set to persist sessions by default
- PWA behavior can differ from regular browser behavior in terms of storage persistence
- Feel free to suggest architectural changes if needed, but prefer minimal invasive solutions

Please start by reading the troubleshooting guide and then examining the current implementation.
